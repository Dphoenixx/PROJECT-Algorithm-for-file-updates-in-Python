# Algorithm for file updates in Python
Project description
Work with a text file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access specific restricted content within a potential organization.
Parsing a file allows security analysts to read and update the contents. Python helps analysts develop algorithms to automate the process of parsing files and keeping them up-to-date.
Develop an algorithm that parses this text file of IP addresses and updates the file by removing addresses that no longer have access to the restricted content.
